        <h1>Sophia Anastasakis's Biography</h1>
        
        <main>
            <p>I’m a magazine, news and digital journalism major interested in applying media skills to a role in public relations for a fashion or beauty company after I graduate.
            </p>
            
            <p>I am the editor-in-chief of an on-campus fashion and beauty magazine. I recently spent a semester working and studying in New York City, and I’m currently working as a public relations intern for a bi-coastal PR firm called Bollare.
            </p>
