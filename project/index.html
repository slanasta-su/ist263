    <div><h1>Sophia Anastasakis</h1>
        <p>I fell in love with writing when I was five years old after my kindergarten teacher gifted me a tiny, red marbled notebook. I spent hours bringing my imagination to life with a pen and paper, filling dozens of notebooks over the years. <br>
        <br>
        I followed my passion for storytelling into college, where I am studying digital journalism at Syracuse University. Every day, I have the opportunity to develop a new project, story, or skill. I’ve been able to learn about my community, educate audiences, uncover injustices, and be a part of various campus organizations – including fashion magazines and radio shows. I even had the opportunity to empower young journalists at the School of the New York Times. <br>
        <br>
        I am an enthusiastic learner, strategic thinker, and soon-to-be graduate from Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Communications. My passion for storytelling fuels my academic and professional journey in public relations, journalism, and digital marketing. Upon my graduation, I aim to forge new paths in the industry, leveraging innovation to inspire change and foster meaningful connections. <br>
        <br>
        Outside of the classroom and office, you can find me trying new recipes and listening to my favorite podcasts — a testament to my commitment to continuous learning.
